# Module_2_Lesson_3_hw_3
**Lesson's topic:**

UI logic. Activity.

**Technical task:**

As a basis, take the application with a personal page of social network from previous lesson.
1. Add an activity where you can change your first name, last name. Also age (select from the drop-down list). And return it to the main activity.
2. Overlay some kind of Layout on top of the base activity, lay out the login form (login, password and the "Login" button) and the validation logic in it. To prevent this Layout from clicking on the page itself, add a property to it.
3. Add the ability to change the user's avatar. To do this, google how to upload a picture from the gallery.


**Screen recoding** (please, note that it was converted to GIF, so it's not smooth as it was):
